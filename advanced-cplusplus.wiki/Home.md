Thanks to Paul T. for adding CMake.

I've tweaked Paul's CMake files a bit to output the binaries in a bin subdirectory of the projects.

You can use CMake to generate projects for various operating systems and compilers. The source code you see here contains CMake-generated Eclipse 4.7 projects.

They were generated by using the following command after cd-ing into each project subdirectory, assuming you've installed CMake: 

`cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_ECLIPSE_VERSION=4.7 .`

For Eclipse, you can import generated projects by using the File menu, Import, "Existing Projects into Workspace".

If you like using the command line, you can simply type `make`in the project folder to build the project.

If you're not using Eclipse or you're using a different version of Eclipse and you want to import the projects, please check appropriate documentation for CMake, for example: [this](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html)
